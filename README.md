## ‚ú® Description

[Lockie](https://lockie-minipay.vercel.app) is a Minipay widget that allows users save in cUSD and earn interest on their savings.

This works by connecting Lockie with [MOOLA market](https://moola.market/) on CELO network, to provide a simple interface where users can deposit into the lending pool, earn interest and withdraw at any time!

The insipiration behind Lockie is to help Africans combat hyperinflation by leveraging on Minipay and the CELO DeFi ecosystem.

## üíª How we built Lockie

We created and deployed Lockie smart contract on Celo Mainnet:

1. Lockie 0x97912976B292131c35c96041fB282c098D23F45B - [View on Celo scan](https://celoscan.io/address/0x97912976B292131c35c96041fB282c098D23F45B)

Here are some of the recent transactions on Lockie:
